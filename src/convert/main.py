"""
What I want to do in this project:
1. Use it for the app's traversal over code
2. Extend the usage and send to PyLEMS community


App requirements:
1. path to input code file
2. path to output folders: eq (1 file containing equations)  and params (2 files: params that include just the
components and their values, and model TYPE as xml containing equations and params)
3. user-specific info on voltage, time, and capacitance
4. units (ms, s, ...) -> taken from the JSON files

PyLEMS:
1. CLI usage
2. Jupyter notebook implementaion tutorial
3. usual python code

Solution:
1. Store CLI and other usage separate
2. Add


Features:
1. Add logger that shows the steps and if there were any mistakes
